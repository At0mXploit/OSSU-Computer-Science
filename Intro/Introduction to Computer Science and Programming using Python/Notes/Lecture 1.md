# Types of knowledge

- Declarative knowledge is a statement of fact.
- Imperative knowledge is recipe or "how-to".

Programming is about writing recipes to generate facts.
Algorithm are recipes/recipes are algorithms.
# Syntax

- Static Semantics: the meaning associated with syntactically correct strings of symbols with no static semantic error.
- English: can have many meanings but programs has only one meaning that programmer intended.

- Example: `The chicken is ready to eat`.

# Objects

- Scalar: Cannot be subdivided like Numbers, Truth value.
- Non-Scalar: Can have internal structure that can be accessed like lists, dictionaries, sequence of characters `abc`.

# Scalar Objects

1) int - integer
2) float - real numbers
3) bool - boolean
4) NoneType - special and has one value, `None`
5) can use `type()` - to see type of object


# Type conversion

- Doesn't actually change object it just makes its replica with another type in memory.
- Can convert on type to another.
- `float(3)` casts int 3 to float 3.0
- `int(3.9)` casts the float 3.9 to int 4.
- Some performs explicit tasks
- `round(3.9)` returns int 4.


# Operators in int and float

- i + j the sum
- i - j the difference
- i * j the product
- i / j the division
- i // j the floor division Eg: 5 // 3 gives 1
- i % j remainder
- i ** j i to the power of j
